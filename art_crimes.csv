1940s,,Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I is a 1907 painting by Gustav Klimt. According to press reports it was sold for US$135 million to Ronald Lauder for his Neue Galerie New York in June 2006 which made it at that time the most expensive painting for about 4 months.[25] It has been on display at the gallery since July 2006. Klimt took three years to complete the painting. It measures 138cm × 138cm and is made of oil and gold on canvas showing elaborate and complex ornamentation as seen in Jugendstil. Klimt was a member of the Vienna Secession a group of artists that broke away from the traditional way of painting. Adele Bloch-Bauer in her will asked her husband to donate the Klimt paintings to the Austrian State Gallery upon his death.[26]  She died in 1925 from meningitis. When the Nazis took over Austria her widowed husband had to flee to Switzerland. His property including the Klimt paintings was confiscated.

1940s,,"Portrait of a Young Man is a painting in oil on panel probably from 1513 to 1514 by the Italian High Renaissance Old Master painter and architect Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino better known simply as Raphael.[28]  The painting was plundered by the Nazis in Poland. The subject's identity is unverified but many scholars have traditionally regarded it as Raphael's self-portrait. The facial features are perceived by specialists as compatible with if not clearly identical to the only undoubted self-portrait by Raphael in his fresco The School of Athens at the Vatican identified as such by Vasari. If it is a self-portrait no hint is given of Raphael's profession; the portrait shows a richly dressed and ""confidently-poised"" young man.[29]  In recent times a book about Nazi plunder by Lynn H. Nicholas and a documentary film by the same title The Rape of Europa suggested that if the painting were to reappear today it would be worth in excess of US$100M.",$100000000[30],Poland,,Falsely reported to have been found 1 August 2012 the location is still unknown.,Plundered by the Nazis,Portrait of a Young Man by Raphael
